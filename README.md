# What, why, how

## Motivation:
![99488a1c-74dc-4e60-85f2-35364ae0c096](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5bbb415-b62c-403d-b4c3-ebd4d3c42001)

## End goal:

- If I have a bunch of ~unorganized info, like notes, tabs, or .pdf papers, I have a semi-automated tooling workflow that can categorize, tag, and organize them.
  - So I will have to do less manual organizing, and hopefully the organizing result will be better than what I can currently achieve.
  - Currently I spend maybe 2-4 hours per month organizing notes, tabs, todos, etc., and this is not enough so I gather a growing backlog constantly, and also I don't have a good system for categorizing and tagging things.

- A script that uses LLM models to figure out categories for
