initial attempts at categorizing a small amount of links with an LLM.

    ([idea]: could use DSPY or another prompt-improvement tool, by building some good example manually and then optimizing on them)



prompt - response pairs:

**Suggested New Categories:**

*   **Philosophy/Rationality:** (Could encompass some of the "self-improvement" links, but with a more philosophical bent)
*   **Chatbots/AI Romance:** (A more specific category for the chatbot romance links)
*   **Digital Culture:** (Could be used for links discussing online trends and behaviors)

```json
[
  "job searches rationality -> mtg",
  "artificial intelligence -> chatbot romance"
]
```

Observations:
    - When I tried adding the suggested categories to the prompt, AI invents new categories
    - When I added the arrows, and many categories, it gets confused about MTG. Since there is no data for "job searches rationality" I guess it tries to allocate something to that anyway? Or something?

Next step:
    - I want to batch run a few hundred links, in sets of dozens, and then get the category lists that the AI outputs, make a coherent list from them as a human, and then use that category list for a proper categorization run and see what comes out.
    - brr coding
    - running the script url_processor.py for ~300 links.
    - Notice it gets stuck at batch 310.
    - There are long query parameters for some google searches there, I'll filter these out manually (if this happens in the future often maybe regex it)
